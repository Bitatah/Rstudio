# introduction

In data analysis, duplicate entries refer to records that appear more
than once in a dataset. These can arise unintentionally due to data
entry errors, merging datasets, or system glitches, and if left
unchecked they can distort analytical results . Duplicates give undue
weight to certain observations, potentially skewing statistics and
leading to misleading conclusions. . For example, duplicate customer
records might inflate sales totals or duplicate experimental
measurements could bias averages. Beyond statistical distortion,
duplicates also waste storage space and computational resources, and can
complicate data management. Therefore, identifying and handling
duplicates is a critical step in data cleaning to ensure the integrity
of any analysis.

This report explores what duplicates are and why they are problematic,
the different types of duplicates, the challenges they pose in analysis,
and demonstrates how to detect and resolve duplicates in R. We will also
walk through a real-world example in RStudio, showing step-by-step how
to identify and address duplicates, and conclude with best practices.
The guidance and code examples are aimed at readers with basic R
knowledge and make use of authoritative resources such as R for Data
Science and official R documentation for reference.

**Types of Duplicates in Data**

Not all duplicates are the same – it’s important to distinguish their
types to handle them appropriately. Common categories include:

Not all duplicates are the same, and understanding their types is key to
handling them correctly. The main categories include:

-   Exact Duplicates: Rows that are completely identical across all
    columns. These usually result from data entry errors or merging
    datasets. They are typically unintentional and should be removed.

-   Partial (Near) Duplicates: Records that share key fields (like ID or
    name) but differ slightly in other values, such as formatting or
    timestamps. These are harder to detect and may require custom rules
    or fuzzy matching.

-   Intentional vs. Unintentional Duplicates: Some duplicates are valid,
    like repeated measurements in longitudinal studies or sales logs.
    These should not be removed but analyzed properly (e.g. aggregated
    or paired).

In contrast, unintentional duplicates—such as repeated entries due to
copy-paste errors—should usually be eliminated.

Even intentional duplicates can cause problems if not handled carefully.
Always evaluate duplicates in context to decide whether to keep,
combine, or drop them.

Why Duplicates Are Problematic: Analytical Challenges

Duplicate records in a dataset can seriously affect the quality and
accuracy of data analysis. Key problems include:

-   Skewed Statistics: Duplicates inflate metrics like totals, means,
    and standard deviations, leading to inaccurate results.

-   Misleading Visuals: Charts and graphs may appear distorted due to
    repeated values, making the data look skewed or clustered when it's
    not.

-   Model Bias: In predictive modeling, duplicates can cause overfitting
    by giving too much weight to certain patterns, which reduces model
    reliability.

-   False Significance: Duplicates can exaggerate correlations and
    affect hypothesis testing by violating the assumption of independent
    observations.

-   Wasted Resources: Extra data increases storage needs and slows down
    processing, especially in large datasets.

-   Data Quality Issues: Unexpected duplicates often signal deeper
    problems like flawed data entry or merging errors.

In short, duplicates must be identified and carefully handled to ensure
valid, efficient, and trustworthy analysis.

# Detecting and Handling Duplicates in R

R provides robust tools for identifying and removing duplicates, both in
base R and in the tidyverse collection of packages. This section details
how to use these tools with code examples.

We will cover base R functions like duplicated(), unique(), and
anyDuplicated(), as well as tidyverse approaches with dplyr (especially
the distinct()function).

Conceptual illustration of identifying and removing duplicate rows in a
dataset (blue rows indicate duplicates). In R, base functions like
duplicated()/unique() and the dplyr function distinct() are commonly
used to address duplicates.

**Base R Techniques for Duplicates**

Base R has built-in functions to detect duplicates and extract unique
values. The primary function is duplicated(), which returns a logical
vector indicating which elements or rows are duplicates of a previous
occurrencerdrr.io. Each element of the vector is TRUE if that
row/element has appeared before and is thus a duplicate, and FALSE if it
is the first occurrence or unique. A related base function, unique(),
returns the unique elements or rows of a vector/data frame, effectively
removing duplicates. Let’s start with a simple example on a vector to
illustrate duplicated():

# A numeric vector with some repeats

x \<- c(1, 1, 4, 5, 4, 6)

# Identify which elements are duplicates

duplicated(x) #\> \[1\] FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE

Here, the output shows TRUE for positions 2 and 5, meaning x\[2\] and
x\[5\] are duplicates of earlier values in the vector (indeed, x\[2\] =
1 is a repeat of x\[1\] = 1, and x\[5\] = 4 repeats x\[3\] = 4). The
first occurrence of a value is not marked as a duplicate – by
definition, duplicated() only flags the subsequent occurrences. We can
use this result to extract or remove duplicates: \# Extract the
duplicate values themselves x\[duplicated(x)\] #\> \[1\] 1 4

# Extract the unique values (remove duplicates)

x\[!duplicated(x)\] #\> \[1\] 1 4 5 6

In the above, x\[duplicated(x)\] returns the values that had appeared
before (1 and 4 in this case). Conversely, prefixing with ! (logical
NOT) gives the values that are not duplicates, effectively the unique
set {1, 4, 5, 6}. Using !duplicated()on a data frame will filter to
unique rows. In fact, the base R unique() function achieves the same:
unique(x) would yield c(1, 4, 5, 6) in this example, and
unique(my_data_frame) removes duplicate rows from a data frame. For data
frames, duplicated() operates row-wise. For example, if we have a data
frame df, duplicated(df) will return a logical vector of length equal to
the number of rows, with TRUE for each row that is identical to a
previous row. We can use this to identify and remove duplicate rows.
Consider a data frame df and the pattern:

dup_rows \<- df\[duplicated(df), \] \# subset of all duplicate rows
(beyond first occurrences) df_no_dups \<- df\[!duplicated(df), \] \#
dataframe with duplicates removed

The first line collects all rows that are duplicates (this will exclude
the first instance of each set of duplicates). The second line keeps
only the rows that are not flagged as duplicates, which is equivalent to
unique(df)

Partial duplicates by column: Sometimes we want to detect duplicates
based on a subset of columns (for instance, find repeated IDs regardless
of other differences). In base R, one can use the duplicated() function
on a specific column or a combination of columns. For example,
duplicated(df\$ID) would flag duplicate IDs in the data frame. We can
also use duplicated(df\[, c("col1","col2")\]) to check for duplicates
with respect to a combination of col1 and col2. Rows where both col1 and
col2 match an earlier row will be marked. As an example, using R’s
built-in iris dataset (which has columns for flower measurements and
species):

# Remove duplicate rows based on a single column, e.g., Sepal.Width

iris_unique_width \<- iris\[ !duplicated(iris\$Sepal.Width), \]

This keeps only the first occurrence of each Sepal.Width value and drops
any later rows that repeat a Sepal.Width seen before. After this
operation, iris_unique_width would have one row per unique sepal width
measurement (in iris, that yields 23 rows out of 150, as there were many
repeated widths). Similarly, one could use multiple columns by
constructing a key, e.g., !duplicated(iris\[,
c("Sepal.Length","Species")\]) to remove rows where both length and
species repeat. R also provides the helper function anyDuplicated(),
which is essentially a faster check to see if any duplicates exist in an
object. It returns the index of the first duplicate found (or 0 if no
duplicates). This is useful for a quick confirmation. For instance:

anyDuplicated(iris) #\> \[1\] 143

The result “143” (hypothetical output) indicates that the 143rd row of
iris is a duplicate of an earlier row (meaning at least one duplicate
exists). If the result were 0, it would mean no duplicates. Using
which(duplicated(iris)) would list all indices of duplicate rows, not
just the first. In summary, base R’s approach to duplicates typically
involves using duplicated() to create a logical index, then subsetting
the data. While effective, it can be a bit clunky for complex operations
(like deciding which duplicates to keep based on some criteria). That’s
where the tidyverse tools often offer more convenience.

Of course! Here's a **longer and more detailed summary** of the section
on **Tidyverse Techniques (dplyr)** for handling duplicates, without
being too lengthy:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tidyverse Techniques (dplyr) – Summary**

In the **tidyverse**, the `dplyr` package offers a clear and powerful
way to detect and remove duplicates using the `distinct()` function. It
works similarly to base R's `unique()`, but is often more efficient and
user-friendly—especially when working with data frames.

🔹 How `distinct()` Works:

-   When you run `distinct(df)`, it returns a new data frame where
    **duplicate rows are removed**, keeping **only the first
    occurrence** of each unique row.
-   The **original order of rows is preserved**, and only the later
    repeated ones are dropped.

🔹 Focusing on Specific Columns:

You don’t have to consider the whole dataset. You can apply `distinct()`
to specific columns to check for uniqueness in part of the data:

``` r
distinct(df, column1, column2, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

-   This keeps **one row per unique combination** of the selected
    columns.
-   The option `.keep_all = TRUE` tells R to keep the entire row (not
    just the selected columns).
-   If you leave `.keep_all = FALSE` (the default), only the columns you
    list will be returned.

🔹 Example Using `iris` Dataset:

The iris dataset has 150 rows. Here’s how you can check and remove
duplicates:

``` r
library(dplyr)

iris_unique <- iris %>% distinct()
nrow(iris_unique)
# Output: 149
```

This confirms that there is **one duplicate row**, and it has been
removed. The `distinct()` function simplifies this task with just one
line of code.

🔹 Using `distinct()` on Subsets of Data:

You can find unique combinations based on just a few columns. For
example:

``` r
iris_species_lengths <- iris %>%
  distinct(Species, Petal.Length, .keep_all = FALSE)
```

This returns only the `Species` and `Petal.Length` columns with unique
combinations, ignoring other variables.

🔹 Counting Duplicates:

Another useful approach is to **count how many times each row or
combination appears**, then filter only those with duplicates:

``` r
iris %>%
  count(Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n > 1)
```

This groups by all key columns and returns rows that appear more than
once, showing exactly how many times each duplicated row is repeated.

If you just want the **number** of duplicated rows:

``` r
# Base R
sum(duplicated(iris))

# Or with dplyr
nrow(iris) - nrow(distinct(iris))
```

Both approaches will return `1` for the iris dataset, because it
contains one duplicate.

🔹 Other Useful Tools:

-   **`janitor::get_dupes()`**: A handy function from the `janitor`
    package that lists duplicate rows and how often each occurs.
-   **`data.table` package**: Offers very fast tools for handling
    duplicates in large datasets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary of Benefits:

-   `distinct()` is easy to read and integrate into data cleaning
    pipelines using `%>%`.
-   It works for full data frames or selected columns.
-   It’s more efficient and consistent than some base R alternatives.
-   Combined with `count()`, it helps **inspect**, not just remove,
    duplicates.
